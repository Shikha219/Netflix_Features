Netflix Feature: Group Similar Titles
Aim:to improve search results by enabling users to see relevant search results without being hindered by typos, which we are calling the “Group Similar Titles” feature.

Complexity measures--
n is the size of the list of strings, and k is the maximum length of a single string.

Time Complexity: O(n*k)O(n∗k), since we are counting each letter for each string in a list

Space Complexity: O(n*k)O(n∗k), since every string is stored as a value in the dictionary, and the size of the string can be kk.
